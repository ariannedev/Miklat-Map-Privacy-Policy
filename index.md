### Location Data

The App accesses your device's location data to:

**How location data is handled:**

- Collected only when the app is actively running and you have granted permission

- We do not intentionally store location data on the device or persist it beyond the active app session
- Not retained beyond the active app session under normal operation
- Not transmitted to our servers or stored in the cloud
- Not shared with third parties (except as required for map display - see [Third-Party Services](#third-party-services))

- Selected default city
- Default city usage preference (always use default city)
- Preferred unit system (metric/imperial)
- Disclaimer acceptance status

**This data is:**

- Stored locally on your device only
- Not transmitted to any servers
- Deleted when you uninstall the app

### Device Information

The App may access:

- Device location services (GPS, network location)
- Internet connectivity (to download map tiles)
- Local storage (to cache map tiles and store settings)

---

## How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information to:

- **Provide core functionality:** Display your location and nearby shelters on the map

## Bomb Shelter Data

### Data Sources

The bomb shelter location database is compiled from:

- Israeli government websites and official listings
- Manual compilation and verification
- Community-sourced information (including publicly available listings on Google Maps and other online sources)

### Data Accuracy

While we make reasonable efforts to provide accurate and up-to-date information:

- Shelter information may be incomplete or outdated
- We cannot guarantee the accuracy of all shelter locations
- We are not responsible for errors in the underlying data sources
- Shelter availability and accessibility may change without notice

### Data Updates

- Shelter data is updated periodically as we receive new information
- Update frequency varies and is not guaranteed
- Users should always verify shelter information through official channels in emergency situations

---

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Processing Only

All user data (location, settings) is processed locally on your device only. We do not operate servers that collect or store your personal information.

### Location Data Handling

- Location coordinates are held temporarily in device memory while the app runs
- No location history is maintained
- Data is automatically cleared when the app is closed
- No persistent storage of location information occurs

### Map Tile Caching

Map tiles from OpenStreetMap are cached locally on your device for performance. These tiles:

- Are standard geographic images without personal information
- May be stored temporarily to reduce data usage
- Can be cleared by clearing the app cache

### Security Measures

We implement security measures to protect your data:

- All data processing happens locally on your device
- No user data is transmitted to our servers
- Location data is used temporarily to provide app functionality and is not retained after use
- No analytics, tracking, or advertising frameworks are used

---

## Third-Party Services

### OpenStreetMap

The App uses map tiles from OpenStreetMap (tile.openstreetmap.org). When downloading map tiles:

- Your device's IP address is sent to OpenStreetMap tile servers
- Tile requests reveal the approximate geographic area you are viewing (which map tiles are needed)
- OpenStreetMap servers may log these requests according to their policies
- We do not control OpenStreetMap's data practices

**OpenStreetMap's privacy policies:**

- [Privacy Policy](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy)
- [Tile Usage Policy](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/tiles/)

### Navigation Services

When you use the "Navigate" feature to get directions to a shelter, the App opens your chosen navigation app and passes the shelter's coordinates to it. This may involve:

**Google Maps:**
- Shelter coordinates are passed to Google Maps
- Google's privacy policy applies: [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

**Apple Maps:**
- Shelter coordinates are passed to Apple Maps
- Apple's privacy policy applies: [https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/)

**Waze:**
- Shelter coordinates are passed to Waze
- Waze's privacy policy applies: [https://www.waze.com/legal/privacy](https://www.waze.com/legal/privacy)

> **Note:** Your current location may also be shared with these navigation apps if you grant them location permissions separately. We do not control how these third-party apps handle your data.

### Platform Services

The App uses platform-specific location services:

- **iOS:** Apple's Core Location framework
- **Android:** Google Play Services Location API

These services have their own privacy policies:

- [Apple Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/)
- [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

We do not control how these platform providers handle location requests.
